.SH DESCRIPTION

.B _xt_ff_pclose(3)
closes a stream opened by xt_ff_popen(3), and
waits for the child process to complete and returns its
exit status.

The xt_ff_t system is simpler than and much faster than
traditional FILE on typical systems.  It is intended for processing
large files character-by-character, where low-level block I/O
is not convenient, but FILE I/O causes a bottleneck.

.SH RETURN VALUES

Exit status of the child process spawned by xt_ff_popen(3), or -1 on error

.na

xt_ff_t *instream;

if ( (instream = xt_ff_popen("xzcat file.xz", O_RDONLY)) == NULL )

    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to read xzcat file.xz.n");
    exit(EX_NOINPUT);
}
