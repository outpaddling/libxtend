.SH DESCRIPTION

.B xt_ff_ungetc(3)
returns a single character read by xt_ff_getc(3) to the input buffer of
a stream opened by xt_ff_open(3).  All characters from the most recently
read block plus a maximum of XT_FAST_FILE_UNGETC_MAX characters
from the previously read block may be returned.

The xt_ff_t system is simpler than and much faster than
traditional FILE on typical systems.  It is intended for processing
large files character-by-character, where low-level block I/O
is not convenient, but FILE I/O causes a bottleneck.

.SH RETURN VALUES

The character written, or EOF if unable to write

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

char    *infilename;
xt_ff_t *instream;
int     ch;

if ( (instream = xt_ff_open(infilename, O_RDONLY)) == NULL )
{
    fprintf(stderr, "Cannot open %s for reading: %s.n",
            infilename, strerror(errno));
    exit(EX_NOINPUT);
}
if ( (ch = xt_ff_getc(instream)) != MY_FAVORITE_CHAR )
    xt_ff_ungetc(ch, instream);
xt_ff_close(instream);
