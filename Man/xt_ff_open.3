.SH DESCRIPTION

.B xt_ff_open(3)
opens a raw data file using _xt_ff_raw_open(3)
or a gzipped, bzipped, or
xzipped file using xt_ff_popen(3), returning a pointer to a xt_ff_t
stream.  Must be used in conjunction with xt_ff_close(3).

The xt_ff_t system is simpler than and much faster than
traditional FILE on typical systems.  It is intended for processing
large files character-by-character, where low-level block I/O
is not convenient, but FILE I/O causes a bottleneck.

.SH RETURN VALUES

A pointer to the FILE structure or NULL if open failed
