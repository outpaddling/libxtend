.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.na
int     xt_ff_seeko(xt_ff_t *stream, off_t offset, int whence)
.ad
.fi

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
stream  Pointer to a xt_ff_t structure
offset  New position in bytes forward or backward from whence
(positive or negative)
whence  SEEK_SET (beginning of file), SEEK_CUR (current position),
or SEEK_END (end of file)
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B xt_ff_seeko(3)
repositions the file descriptor underlying stream to any
position within the file, using lseek(2).  It is analogous
to fseeko(3).  The stream must refer to a regular file, as
pipes are not generally seekable.

.SH RETURN VALUES

0 on success, -1 on failure (errno set)

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

// Reposition so that 10th byte in the file is the next one read
xt_ff_seeko(stream, 10, SEEK_SET);
.ad
.fi

.SH SEE ALSO

fseek(3), lseek(2)
