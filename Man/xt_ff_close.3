.SH DESCRIPTION

.B xt_ff_close(3)
closes a xt_ff_t stream by calling
_xt_ff_raw_close(3) or _xt_ff_pclose(3) as appropriate.
Automatically determines the proper close function to call using
S_ISFIFO() on the stream stat structure.

The xt_ff_t system is simpler than and much faster than
traditional FILE on typical systems.  It is intended for processing
large files character-by-character, where low-level block I/O
is not convenient, but FILE I/O causes a bottleneck.

.SH RETURN VALUES

The value returned by _xt_ff_raw_close(3) or _xt_ff_pclose(3)
