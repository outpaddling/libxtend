.SH DESCRIPTION

This function redirects the stdin, stdout, and stderr of the current
process to the files named by the corresponding arguments.  The original
file streams are not preserved.  If you need to restore any of these
streams to their original state, they must be saved (e.g. using dup(),
dup2(), or ttyname()) prior to calling xt_redirect().
