.SH DESCRIPTION

xt_spawnvp() and xt_spawnlp() are wrappers around fork(2) and exec(3)
which make it easy to run a child process without an intermediate
shell process as is used by system(3).  The xt_spawnlp() function
spawns a child process using a variable argument list.  The 6th
argument is passed to argv[0] of the child, the 7th to argv[1], etc.

The xt_spawnvp() function spawns a process using the command contained
in an argv[] array constructed by the caller.  xt_spawnlp() automatically
constructs such an argv[] array and calls xt_spawnvp().

The calling process waits for the child to complete if P_WAIT is
passed to parent_action, or continues immediately if P_NOWAIT
is passed.  If P_ECHO is passed as the echo argument, the command
is echoed, the command is echoed to the parent's stdout.

If infile, outfile, or errfile are not NULL, then the corresponding
file streams stdin, stdout, or stderr are redirected to the filename
provided.

.SH RETURN VALUES

The exit status of the child process if P_WAIT is passed
The PID of the child process if P_NOWAIT is passed
